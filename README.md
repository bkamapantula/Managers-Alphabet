# Managers-Alphabet
Good practices as an engineering manager. Generally, these apply to managers who aren't engineers too.

*Note: my experience is in software industry, academic research. Your mileage may vary. Adopt accordingly.*

I've been at [Gramener](https://gramener.com) for over three years and 19 months of those as an engineering manager. Prior to that I spent about 8 years in academic research with different mentors. Real-time experience in projects and dealing with people simultaneously helped me understand different situations.

Clearbit's [Manager's Handbook](https://blog.clearbit.com/managers-handbook-tldr/) was a trigger to curate best practices. I realized Clearbit's version of handbook can be more explicit for easier understanding and adoption.

A not too different version of the document was adopted at Gramener. Links to contexts internal to Gramener (calendars, learning material) have been removed due to authentication restrictions.

## Appraisal Discussions

Appraisal discussions are the hardest meetings.

**Preparation**

Prepare to communicate feedback from HRMS questions. Typically 3-5 weeks notice is given by the People Team to managers to complete the feedback. If planned well one can complete the assessment within time and arrange for a one-on-one discussion with the reportee.

- Assess based on their current role.
- Talk to all managers with whom they have worked in the past one year.
- Leverage project reviews and feedback from that.

Accumulate everything and prepare the discussion points.

**Communication**

- Give evidence backed feedback.
- Assess the person in the past year. Monthly one-on-ones help iteratively aggregate feedback.

Productive Appraisal discussions can be achieved within 30 mins. Multiple discussions may be required depending on the feedback.

**Using SMART Goals**

SMART Goals are a way to measure incremental progress at internals of three months (that is, a quarter). Read [its section](#smart-goals) to know more.

## Breaks

Work can get hectic from time to time. Personally, take regular breaks. If you’re unable to take leaves find a buddy who can hold you to take breaks regularly. 

Next, enable your team to take regular breaks.

- Identify over-worked people (Timesheet report can help). However, people can over-work and still not fill Timesheet. Track using other means (code activity, project activity, emails, personal assessment etc.).
- Between phases of a project, give people a break for few days to recuperate.
- After a long-term project completes consider rotating the key people (if they're inclined) who worked a lot.
- Often, people follow the behaviour of their managers, role models, mentors. Take breaks, personally.

## Communication

Good communication is a foundation skill of a manager.

**Asynchronous over Synchronous**

`Hangouts` and `WhatsApp` are comfortable for messaging but are a medium for urgent communication. There’s a constant urge to reply to messages.

However, tasks are better managed over emails. People can get to emails whenever they’ve time (as they are occupied with work tasks) as they don’t need our immediate attention like chat services do. This mode is asynchronous.

Read [Basecamp’s handbook](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/how-we-work.md#asynchronously) for the benefits of asynchronous communication.

**Conflict management**

In a dynamic working environment conflicts can arise in different scenarios: during allocation, project meetings, discussions, appraisals etc.

Work to resolve them calmly.

Also see [Firefighting](#firefighting) below.

## Deep work

Encourage deep work within your team and practice it yourself.

*Talk video: Know about* [*the benefits*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UmUgaJwEr0) *of long periods of uninterrupted time.*

Designers and developers need long hours of dedicated work to be productive. Identify blockers for them (talk to them) and help them focus.

Identify what’s hindering the work you want to do.

It could be ad-hoc calls. Block your calendar for 3 hr stretches where you cannot be disturbed. Refer people to check your calendar. Configure auto-SMS messages.
