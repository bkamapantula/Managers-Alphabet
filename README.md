Good practices as a manager.

I've been at [Gramener](https://gramener.com) for over three years and 19 months of those as a manager. Clearbit's [Manager's Handbook](https://blog.clearbit.com/managers-handbook-tldr/) was a trigger to curate best practices. I realized Clearbit's version of handbook can be more explicit for easier understanding and adoption.

A not too different version of the document was adopted at Gramener.
